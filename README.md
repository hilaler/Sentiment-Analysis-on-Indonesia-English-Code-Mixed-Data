# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Indonesia-English-Code-Mixed-Data
Social media like facebook and twitter were really famous over the past decade. The users of social media has exponentially risen in some countries like Indonesia has given rise to large volumes of code-mixed data, in which users use more than one language in a single text. Data with code-mixed is often noisy because the same word is written multiple times, the words in the sentence are not clearly ordered, random abbreviations are used, and most importantly the monolingual model usually does not work well on it. In this work, the author will explore sentiment analysis on English-Indonesian code-mixed data. The approach that will be used is by utilizing a multilingual pre-trained model, mBERT. The evaluation will be performed based on the classification performance metrics: precision, recall, and F-1 score.
